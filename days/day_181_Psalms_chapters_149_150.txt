Day 181:

Reading Psalms, chapters ['149', '150']:

  Chapter 149.

    1: Sing ye to the Lord a new canticle: let his praise be in the church of the saints. 
    2: Let Israel rejoice in him that made him: and let the children of Sion be joyful in their king. 
    3: Let them praise his name in choir: let them sing to him with the timbrel and the psaltery. 
    4: For the Lord is well pleased with his people: and he will exalt the meek unto salvation. 
    5: The saints shall rejoice in glory: they shall be joyful in their beds.
    6: The high praise of God shall be in their mouth: and two-edged swords in their hands: 
    7: To execute vengeance upon the nations, chastisements among the people: 
    8: To bind their kings with fetters, and their nobles with manacles of iron. 
    9: To execute upon them the judgment that is written: this glory is to all his saints. Alleluia.

  Chapter 150.

    1: Praise ye the Lord in his holy places: praise ye him in the firmament of his power. 
    2: Praise ye him for his mighty acts: praise ye him according to the multitude of his greatness. 
    3: Praise him with sound of trumpet: praise him with psaltery and harp. 
    4: Praise him with timbrel and choir: praise him with strings and organs. 
    5: Praise him on high sounding cymbals: praise him on cymbals of joy: let every spirit praise the Lord. Alleluia.
